## Mission Statement

To empower seamless healthcare interoperability through an open, community-driven integration engine that is accessible, extensible, and standards-based.

---

## Overview

The **Open Integration Engine Project** is an open-source initiative committed to advancing healthcare interoperability. Building upon the foundation of **Mirth Connect**, a widely adopted integration engine, this project aims to provide healthcare organizations with a robust, flexible, and cost-effective solution for connecting disparate systems and facilitating efficient data exchange.

---

## Codebase Structure

The repository is organized into the following primary modules:

- `client/` – Desktop administrator interface for configuring and monitoring channels.
- `server/` – Core runtime engine and web services that process and route messages.
- `command/` – Command-line utilities for interacting with a running server.
- `donkey/` – Underlying message-processing framework shared by server components.
- `manager/` – Desktop tool for managing the engine as a service on various platforms.
- `generator/` – Templates and scripts for creating custom extensions.
- `simplesender/` – Example utility for sending test messages to the server.
- `webadmin/` – Web-based administrative console.
- `tools/` – Build and packaging utilities, such as Install4j configurations.

---

## Why Open Integration Engine?

- **Open Source Advantage**  
  Transparency, innovation, and collaborative development within the healthcare IT community.

- **Healthcare-Focused**  
  Designed to address the unique challenges of healthcare data integration, supporting standards such as HL7, FHIR, and DICOM.

- **Extensible and Customizable**  
  Modular architecture for customization and expansion to meet evolving needs.

---

## Core Features

- **Data Transformation and Mapping**  
  Convert between HL7, JSON, XML, and other formats to ensure cross-system compatibility.

- **Message Routing and Filtering**  
  Route messages using flexible, rules-based logic to streamline workflows.

- **Custom Scripting and Connectors**  
  JavaScript-based scripting and support for protocols like HTTP/S, FTP, and database connectivity.

- **Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts**  
  Visual tools for tracking message flow, performance metrics, and setting up alerts.
